description: |
  STRING is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions.
  The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional)
  associations derived from genomic context predictions, high-throughput
  lab experiments, coexpression data, automated textmining, and previous
  knowledge in databases. STRING also provides functional enrichment
  analysis against GO, KEGG, and other databases.

capabilities:
  - Get protein-protein interaction networks
  - Perform functional enrichment analysis
  - Find interaction partners for a protein
  - Test network connectivity significance
  - Generate network visualization URLs
  - Find homologs/orthologs across species

triggers:
  keywords:
    - string
    - protein interaction
    - ppi
    - interaction network
    - protein network
    - interactome
    - enrichment analysis
    - functional enrichment
  patterns:
    - "protein.*interact"
    - "interact.*protein"
    - "network.*gene"
    - "enrichment.*gene"
    - "what.*interact.*with"

      default: 9606
    - name: required_score
      type: integer
      description: Minimum interaction confidence (0-1000)

examples:
  - prompt: "Get protein interactions for TP53"
    expected_params:
      identifiers: ["TP53"]
      species: 9606
    expected_behavior: "Returns TP53 interaction partners with confidence scores"
    
  - prompt: "Run enrichment analysis on my gene list BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, ATM"
    expected_params:
      identifiers: ["BRCA1", "BRCA2", "TP53", "ATM"]
    expected_behavior: "Returns enriched pathways and GO terms for DNA repair genes"
    
  - prompt: "Find what proteins interact with MDM2 in mouse"
    expected_params:
      identifiers: ["MDM2"]
      species: 10090
    expected_behavior: "Returns mouse MDM2 interaction network"

tool_binding:
  tool_name: search_string
  tool_module: workflow_composer.agents.tools.databases
  function: get_string_client().get_interactions

confidence_levels:
  - score: 150
    label: low confidence
  - score: 400
    label: medium confidence
  - score: 700
    label: high confidence
  - score: 900
    label: highest confidence

best_practices:
  - Use medium confidence (400) as default threshold
  - For physical interaction studies, use required_score >= 700
  - Include enough genes (>5) for meaningful enrichment
  - Use species parameter to ensure correct organism

limitations:
  - Rate limited to 1 request per second
  - Enrichment requires minimum 3-5 genes
  - Some interactions are computational predictions
