  PubMed comprises more than 35 million citations for biomedical literature
  from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. It is the primary
  resource for finding scientific literature in biology, medicine, and
  related fields. The client provides search, citation retrieval, and
  related article discovery.

capabilities:
  - Search for articles by keywords, authors, or topics
  - Retrieve article abstracts and metadata
  - Find related articles for a given publication
  - Get articles that cite a specific paper
  - Search by MeSH terms
  - Find recent publications

      limit: 20
    expected_behavior: "Returns recent papers on CRISPR gene editing technology"
    
  - prompt: "Find recent papers on single cell RNA-seq from 2023"
    expected_params:
      query: "single cell RNA-seq"
      date_from: "2023"
      sort: "pub_date"
    expected_behavior: "Returns 2023 papers on scRNA-seq sorted by date"
    
  - prompt: "Get papers by Jennifer Doudna"
    expected_params:
      query: "Doudna JA[Author]"
    expected_behavior: "Returns publications by Jennifer Doudna"

tool_binding:
  tool_name: search_pubmed
  tool_module: workflow_composer.agents.tools.databases
  function: get_pubmed_client().search

best_practices:
  - Use MeSH terms for controlled vocabulary searches
  - Combine terms with AND/OR for specific queries
  - Use [Title] qualifier for title-only searches
  - Register for NCBI API key for higher rate limits
  - Use date filters to find recent research

limitations:
  - Rate limited to 3 requests/second (10 with API key)
  - Abstracts may not be available for all articles
  - Full text not accessible through API
  - Some recent articles may not be indexed yet
