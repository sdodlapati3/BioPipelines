description: |
  Compare two samples or conditions with statistical analysis
  and visualization suggestions. Helps interpret differences
  between experimental conditions.

capabilities:
  - Compare gene expression between conditions
  - Analyze methylation differences
  - Compare variant profiles
  - Suggest appropriate statistical tests
  - Recommend visualization methods
  - Identify significant differences

aliases:
  - compare conditions
  - compare groups
  - difference between
  - contrast analysis

triggers:
  keywords:
    - compare samples
    - compare conditions
    - difference between
    - versus
    - contrast
  patterns:
    - "compare.*samples"
    - "compare.*conditions"
    - "difference.*between"
    - "vs\\."
    - "versus"

parameters:
  required:
    - name: sample1
      type: string
      description: First sample or condition
    - name: sample2
      type: string
      description: Second sample or condition
  optional:
    - name: comparison_type
      type: string
      description: Type of comparison
      default: expression
      enum: [expression, methylation, variants, peaks]
    - name: statistical_test
      type: string
      description: Statistical test to use
      enum: [t-test, wilcoxon, DESeq2, edgeR]

examples:
  - query: "Compare treated vs control samples"
    expected_behavior: Suggests DE analysis approach
    parameters:
      sample1: treated
      sample2: control

  - query: "What's the difference between tumor and normal?"
    expected_behavior: Recommends comparative analysis
    parameters:
      sample1: tumor
      sample2: normal

outputs:
  - name: comparison_method
