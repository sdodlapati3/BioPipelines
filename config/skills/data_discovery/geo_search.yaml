description: |
  Search NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for gene expression datasets.
  GEO is the largest public repository for functional genomics data including
  microarray, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and methylation data.

capabilities:
  - Search by keywords, organism, or experiment type
  - Find datasets by GEO accession (GSE, GSM, GPL)
  - Filter by platform type (microarray, sequencing)
  - Access raw and processed data
  - Retrieve sample metadata and experimental design
  - Download supplementary files

aliases:
  - geo
  - gene expression omnibus
  - ncbi geo
  - gse

triggers:
  keywords:
    - search geo
    - find geo
    - geo datasets
    - geo database
    - gse search
    - gene expression omnibus
  patterns:
    - "search.*geo"
    - "find.*in geo"
    - "geo.*data"
    - "GSE\\d+"
    - "download.*geo"

parameters:
  required:
    - name: query
      type: string
      description: Search terms or GEO accession number
  optional:
    - name: organism
      type: string
      description: Filter by organism
      default: human
    - name: study_type
      type: string
      description: Type of study
      enum: [expression profiling by array, expression profiling by high throughput sequencing, methylation profiling, genome binding/occupancy profiling]
    - name: entry_type
      type: string
      description: GEO entry type
      enum: [gse, gds, gpl, gsm]
      default: gse
    - name: limit
      type: integer
      description: Maximum results to return
      default: 20

examples:
  - query: "Search GEO for breast cancer RNA-seq datasets"
    expected_behavior: Returns RNA-seq studies related to breast cancer
    parameters:
      organism: human
      study_type: expression profiling by high throughput sequencing

  - query: "Find GSE12345"
    expected_behavior: Returns metadata and files for the specific GEO series
    parameters:
      query: GSE12345

  - query: "Get methylation datasets for Alzheimer's disease"
    expected_behavior: Returns methylation profiling studies related to Alzheimer's
    parameters:
      study_type: methylation profiling

outputs:
  - name: datasets
    type: array
    description: List of matching GEO datasets with accessions
  - name: metadata
    type: object
    description: Study metadata including title, summary, samples
  - name: supplementary_files
    type: array
    description: Available supplementary files for download

related_skills:
  - encode_search
  - sra_search
  - download_dataset

best_practices:
  - Use GEO accession numbers for direct access to known datasets
  - Check sample sizes and replicate numbers before analysis
  - Verify platform compatibility for meta-analysis
  - Download processed data when available for faster analysis
  - Review experimental design in series matrix files

limitations:
  - Metadata quality varies by submitter
  - Some older datasets may lack raw sequencing data
  - Large datasets may require SRA download tools
  - Processing pipelines may differ between datasets
