version: "1.0.0"
category: database
subcategory: protein

description: |
  UniProt is the comprehensive protein sequence and functional database.
  It combines Swiss-Prot (manually reviewed, high-quality annotations)
  and TrEMBL (computationally analyzed entries) to provide detailed
  protein information including sequences, functions, domains, variants,
  and post-translational modifications.

capabilities:
  - Search for proteins by gene name, protein name, or keywords
  - Retrieve protein sequences in FASTA format
  - Get functional annotations and descriptions
  - Access Gene Ontology (GO) terms
  - Filter by organism and review status
  - Batch retrieval of multiple proteins

triggers:
  keywords:
    - uniprot
    - protein database
    - protein sequence
    - protein function
    - swiss-prot
    - protein annotation
    - get protein
    - search protein
    - protein info
  patterns:
    - "search.*protein"
    - "find.*protein"
    - "get.*protein.*sequence"
    - "what.*protein"
    - "protein.*function"
  intents:
    - PROTEIN_SEARCH
    - PROTEIN_INFO
    - DATABASE_SEARCH

parameters:
  required:
    - name: query
      type: string
      description: Search terms - gene name, protein name, or keywords
      example: "BRCA1"
  optional:
    - name: organism
      type: string
      description: Filter by organism (human, mouse, etc.)
      default: human
      enum: [human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, drosophila, yeast]
    - name: reviewed
      type: boolean
      description: Only return Swiss-Prot (reviewed) entries
      default: true
    - name: limit
      type: integer
      description: Maximum results to return
      default: 25
      max: 500

outputs:
  type: list
  description: List of protein entries
  item_schema:
    accession: UniProt accession number
    protein_name: Full protein name
    gene_names: List of gene symbols
    organism: Species name
    function: Functional description
    sequence_length: Length in amino acids
    go_terms: Gene Ontology annotations

examples:
  - prompt: "Search UniProt for BRCA1 protein in human"
    expected_params:
      query: "BRCA1"
      organism: "human"
      reviewed: true
    expected_behavior: "Returns Swiss-Prot entries for human BRCA1"
    
  - prompt: "Get the protein sequence for TP53"
    expected_params:
      query: "TP53"
    expected_behavior: "Returns TP53 protein information including sequence"
    
  - prompt: "Find all mouse proteins involved in apoptosis"
    expected_params:
      query: "apoptosis"
      organism: "mouse"
    expected_behavior: "Returns mouse proteins annotated with apoptosis function"

tool_binding:
  tool_name: search_uniprot
  tool_module: workflow_composer.agents.tools.databases
  function: get_uniprot_client().search

best_practices:
  - Use reviewed=true to get only high-quality Swiss-Prot entries
  - Search by gene symbol for most accurate results
  - Use organism filter to narrow down results
  - For batch queries, use batch_retrieve method with accession list

limitations:
  - Maximum 500 results per query
  - Rate limited to 10 requests per second
  - TrEMBL entries may have incomplete annotations
