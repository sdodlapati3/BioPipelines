category: database
subcategory: pathway

description: |
  Reactome is a free, open-source, curated and peer-reviewed pathway
  database that provides intuitive bioinformatics tools for visualization,
  interpretation, and analysis of pathway knowledge. Unlike KEGG, Reactome
  pathways are represented as detailed reaction networks with explicit
  molecular interactions, making it excellent for mechanistic understanding.

capabilities:
  - Search for pathways, reactions, and complexes
  - Perform statistically rigorous pathway enrichment
  - Get pathway hierarchy and relationships
  - Find all pathways containing a gene
  - Retrieve protein complex components
  - Generate pathway diagram URLs

  keywords:
    - reactome
    - pathway analysis
    - pathway enrichment
    - biological process
    - signaling
    - reaction
    - pathway diagram
    - pathway visualization

tool_binding:
  tool_name: search_reactome
  tool_module: workflow_composer.agents.tools.databases
  function: get_reactome_client().search

enrichment_output:

  - entities_found: Genes from input found in pathway
  - entities_total: Total genes in pathway

best_practices:
  - Use analyze_genes() for proper statistical enrichment
  - Filter by FDR < 0.05 for significant pathways
  - Reactome IDs start with R-[species code] (e.g., R-HSA-*)
  - Use pathway hierarchy to understand relationships
  - Consider both Reactome and KEGG for comprehensive coverage

limitations:
  - Mainly focused on human pathways
  - Some pathways are computationally projected to other species
  - Rate limited to 5 requests per second
